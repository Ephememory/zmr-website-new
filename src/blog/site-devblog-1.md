Welcome to the new website! This site is made possible with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github Pages is a static web hosting service that lets you host your website from a Github repository. Yes, this website's source code can be found [on its Github repository](https://github.com/zm-reborn/zmr-website-new). Our previous website wasn't particularly good. I essentially made it in a week for a school assignment and then completely forgot about it. It was pure, non-optimized and terrible HTML.

For this project, I chose [Eleventy static website generator](https://www.11ty.dev/) as it supports writing blogs and I was somewhat familiar with it already. I wanted to choose one that was completely new to me, but the only other [popular alternative](https://jekyllrb.com/) used Ruby... so I gave up and used Eleventy instead. :)

The site works by writing Markdown. Think BBCode but modern. You can do all sorts of cool stuff like embed videos...

# Do stuff with headers

- lists
- wowzers

...all by writing markdown.
